                    Some web browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to Do Not Track signals, our Platform does not currently respond to such signals. <span className='text-[#3c4e3d]/60'>If you want to restrict ads in general on your devices, you may opt out from ad tracking by enabling “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt Out of Ads Personalization” (as applicable to your device) in your device settings.</span>
