Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, better understand how site visitors use the website, and provide more targeted content to its site visitors. SDKs are a set of tools that provides a developer with the ability to build a custom Platform which can be added on, or connected to, another program.

Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. We also may use multi-session (persistent) cookies on our Website. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or device for longer periods and are used for purposes including session management (for example, to recognize you and recall your individual login information and preferences) and tracking the number of unique visitors to our Website and information such as the number of views a page gets, how much time a user spends on a page, and other pertinent web statistics.
