If the Parties do not reach such solution within a period of thirty (30) days, then all disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by and submitted to a single arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), in accordance with its then existing rules; however, upon the written demand of any party to the arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by and submitted to three Arbitrators. The arbitration hearing shall be held in New York, New York. Depositions may be taken and full discovery may be obtained in any arbitration commenced under this arbitration provision.</span>

Each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Arbitrator(s) and AAA; however, the Arbitrator(s) shall be authorized to determine whether a party is the prevailing party and, if so, to award to that prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or the fees and costs of the Arbitrator(s) and AAA. The Arbitrator(s), and not a court, shall also be authorized to determine whether this Arbitration Provision applies to a Claim sought to be resolved hereunder. The Arbitrator(s) shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing, issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.

Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the Parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.

                        Atria charges an initiation fee and an annual membership fee (the “Annual Membership Fee”) for access to certain features of the Platform. The Annual Membership Fee may be modified by Atria from time to time.

The Annual Membership Fee is not a covered benefit under health insurance plans or other healthcare benefit plans such as the Health Saving Account or Flexible Spending Account. As a result, you acknowledge that you may not be able to submit the Annual Membership Fee for coverage under your insurance or benefit plan, and as such, you will be responsible for the cost of such Annual Membership Fee.
